// INTRO:   Having spent more time Lessons 3 and 4 than I had anticipated,
            // I think that the fundamental problem with the entire module as it relates to
            // Gulp is that the material seems based on Gulp 3, which is now deprecated,
            // as opposed to Gulp 4.  Thus, by default, when I installed Gulp with npm,
            // I was getting a version that was not really compatible with the course content.
            // This was surprising, and for Lesson 4 I ended up rewriting gulpfile.js to be
            // compatible with Gulp 4.
